When you embed a website which will return 307 to a website which require Windows Authentication, Edge might not prompt for credentials. And we will see "Tracking Prevention blocked access for storage for <URL>"

# Cause


When your proxy hostname is in the list of [disconnect-tracking-protection
/services.json](https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection/blob/master/services.json), Edge will use private mode to access the webpage and then it will suppress WIA in 3rd party contexts.

# Solutions
A few options to resolve this issue:

- Use a customized hostname instead of a hostname which is listed in disconnect-tracking-protection/services.json.
- Disable tracking prevention feature
- Set the prevention feature to Basic

# Repro
1. Download Fiddler Auto Responder rules from [NoCredentialDialogIssue.farx](https://crushonme-1256821258.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/NoCredentialDialogIssue.farx)
1. Access [NoCredentialDialogIssueNormalScenario](https://brave-plant-0ddc21400.3.azurestaticapps.net/NoCredentialDialogIssueNormalScenario.html) and we will see the credential dialog.
1. Access [NoCredentialDialogIssueAbnormalScenario](https://brave-plant-0ddc21400.3.azurestaticapps.net/NoCredentialDialogIssueAbnormalScenario.html) and you will see no credential dialog and we will see error "Tracking Prevention blocked access for storage for <URL>" in F12 Console.

>Notes
>
> In this repro, we returned 307 to redirect to a proxy URL. In the abnormal scenario, the proxy URL is proxy.fb.com. And in normal scenario, the proxy URL is proxy.com. fb.com is listed in [disconnect-tracking-protection
/services.json](https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection/blob/master/services.json). Then when we try to access proxy.fb.com, we will see below information in net-export log
