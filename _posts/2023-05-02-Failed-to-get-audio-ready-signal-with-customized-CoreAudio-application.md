In the ETL trace, we will also see maxxaudiocapture64.dll module takes too much time.

# Cause
The main APO processing thread is blocked due to third party components. 

[Audio Processing Object Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/audio-processing-object-architecture)

# resolution

Suggest engaging the product vendor to remove/upgrade this MaxxVoice APO and the issue should mitigate (as the main APO processing wonâ€™t be blocked any more).

Workaround:
Renames either maxxaudiocapture64.dll or the whole folder then restarts audiosrv can make the headset speaker and headset mic both working fine.
